# Word and Excel Data Extractor
This is a C# program consisting of 2 different solutions, where one of them extracts data from Word files and the other extracts data from Excel files. 

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* Microsoft Visual Studio
  * C# Console Application

## Setup & Run
To run this project, each solution (.sln) file in their corresponding folders must be opened with Visual Studio separately to be built and run since the programs require Microsoft Word/Excel Object Library References.\
The input files related to each program are given in both the root directories and the execution working directories of each solution: **.../bin/Debug/net6.0/**
